        # Some problem with Tomcat prevents deployment: Sometimes when tomcat fails to unregister the JDBC driver a thread is created called: [mysql-cj-abandoned-connection-cleanup]. If this happens Tomcat cannot undeploy the application and the following will not work.
        # Solution: restart the tomcat container.
